🚀 **Digital Transformation is More Than Just Technology**  

Many companies embark on digital transformation by investing in tools without a clear vision, leading to technological silos, misalignment with business goals, and limited scalability. Without a well-defined architecture, innovation becomes a challenge rather than an advantage.

**This is where I come in.** With +8 years of experience I’ve worked with companies across various industries (E-Commerce, Retail, Manufacturing), helping them turn technology into a true driver of transformation. My approach blends:  

🔹 **Strategic Vision** → Understanding the business before designing the solution.  
🔹 **Pragmatic Mindset** → It’s not about the latest technology, but the right one.  
🔹 **Architecture with Impact** → Designs that create value from day one.
